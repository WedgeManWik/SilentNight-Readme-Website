I created this game for one of my University assignments. We were learning and getting introduced to using Unity, which I found to be a very interesting learning experience. With the various tools provided by Unity, help from lecturers and some video tutorials I managed to create this game in 10 weeks.

## Game Description 

### Playing the game

#### Some basic rules

The player has to survive 10 rounds of zombies to win the game. They start off with a basic Model 860 shotgun, and can use this to kill the zombies which spawn in. The player will gain points from hitting the zombies, and will also be awarded extra points when killing a zombie. The player may spend these earnt points on purchasing guns, ammo and an upgrade. 

#### The Zombies

The zombies have very good sense off smell and can detect the player's scent from far away. The zombies' aims are to catch the player and infect them with their virus. In the first round, the zombies start off with 100 health points and only a few spawn; however, with every round the zombies get slightly stronger and spawn in greater numbers. In order for the player to keep up with this, they have to pick the gun of their choice, save up for it, get upgrades, dodge the zombies and stay out of range of their swing. If the player is too far away for a zombie's sense of smell, the zombie will stay idle. However, if the player is withing range, they will start chasing the player, and ultimately attack the player if close enough!

#### Player Info & Controls

The player is a sole survivor who is desperately trying to kill and get away from the zombies, they are imprisoned in an abandoned city which engulfs them, and their only way to survive is to run and murder the zombies around them!

The player can move around the map by using the “W”, “A”, "S" and “D” keys, Space bar to jump, left mouse click to fire their weapon, right mouse click to aim down sights, the "R" key to reload and the "E" key to interact.

The player may only fire their weapon when they're aiming down sights.

When shooting a gun, the player may hold down the left mouse button to rapid fire the gun. This will only work for guns which have this fire mode such as sub-machine guns and assault rifles. The player has limited ammo and so may need to purchase some new ammo from the ammo crate in the middle of the map, or purchase a new gun.

The player may also upgrade their gun in the upgrade machine, this will increase the gun's damage and give it a blood red glow whenever the player fires.

#### The Guns

Around the map there are various guns placed around, the player can purchase these guns if they have enough points. Each gun has different rate of fire, damage, reload time, cost, ammo per mag and firing sound. Some weapons even have a unique characteristic such as the sniper rifle which has such a powerful impact it can penetrate through multiple zombies if alligned in a row!

The guns may be upgraded in the upgrade machine, and can be repurchased multiple times.
